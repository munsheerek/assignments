	<a href="">GO TO TOP</a>
		<p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithematic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
	<h3 id="cpu">cpu</h3>
		<p>A central processing unit (CPU),also referred to as a central processor unit,is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by perfoming the basic arithematical, logical, and input output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry atleast since early 1960s. The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundemental operation remains much the same</p>
	<h3 id="alu">ALU</h3>
	<p>
		In computing, an arithematic and logic unit (ALU) is adigital circuit that perfoms integer arithematic and logical operations. The ALU is a fundemental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphic processig units (GPUs) accomodate very powerful and very complex ALUs; a single component may contain a number of ALUs.

	<h2 id="programming">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h2>
		<p> The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal. Each language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions</p>
	<h3 id="c">c</h3>
		<p>The C language is a structure oriented programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie. The C language is belonging to middle level programming language. Operating system programs such as Windows, Unix, Linux are written in C language.C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.</p><br>
	<h3 id="c++">c++</h3>
		<p>C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style".C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called "C with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes." However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
	<h2 id="dbms">DBMS</h2>
		<p>A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.</p>
	<h3 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h3>
		<p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.</p>
	<h3 id="oodbms">OODBMS</h3>
		<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects. Most of the object databases also offer some kind of query language, permitting objects to be found through a declarative programming approach.Also called an object database management system (ODMS).
		</p>
	<h3 id="hdbms">HDBMS</h3>
		<p>A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains.A record in the hierarchical database model corresponds to a row (or tuple) in the relational database model and an entity type corresponds to a table (or relation).</p>
	<h3 id="nwdbms">NWDBMS</h3>
		<p>A network database is a type of database model wherein multiple member records or files can be linked to multiple owner files and vice versa. The model can be viewed as an upside-down tree where each member information is the branch linked to the owner, which is the bottom of the tree. Essentially, relationships are in a net-like form where a single element can point to multiple data elements and can itself be pointed to by multiple data elements.
